# Arduino_Songs


A list of songs playable on the Arduino platform IDE and MCUs.

The `tone()` function is used for dynamic melodies.

Unfortunately the songs do use `delay()` but will add a version without using `millis()`.

Todo
- Remove *delay()* add *millis()* version
- keep same format for easy integration
